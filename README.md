# Guild Bank Restock

A World of Warcraft addon that automates buying items from the Auction House using [Auctionator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator). Designed for restocking a guild bank with gems, enchants, potions, flasks, and weapon oils/stones.

## Requirements

- World of Warcraft: Midnight (12.x / Retail)
- [Auctionator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator) addon

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `GuildBankRestock` folder into your WoW AddOns directory:
   ```
   World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\GuildBankRestock
   ```
3. Launch WoW and enable the addon in the AddOns menu on the character select screen

## Modes

The addon has two operating modes, toggled with the **Bulk** and **Restock** buttons in the main window.

### Bulk mode
Buys a fixed quantity of each selected item regardless of what is already in the guild bank. Good for restocking at the start of a new expansion when the bank is empty.

1. Type `/restock` to open the window and select **Bulk**
2. Check the items you want and set the **Qty** for each
3. Open the AH and switch to the **Auctionator Shopping** tab
4. Click **Start** — the addon searches and queues purchases for every enabled item

### Restock mode
Scans the guild bank to determine what is actually needed before buying anything. Requires visiting the guild bank first.

1. Open the guild bank and click the **Scan for Restock** button that appears on the bank UI — the addon queries all tabs and prints "Guild bank scanned." when done
2. Type `/restock` to open the window and select **Restock**
3. Create or select a profile using the `+` / `-` / `<` / `>` controls next to the mode buttons
4. Set a **Target** quantity per item — this is the stock level you want to maintain in the bank
5. The **To Buy** column is calculated automatically (`Target − in bank`) but can be edited before starting
6. Optionally use **R1** / **R2** / **Both** to filter ranked items across all tabs
7. Open the AH and switch to the **Auctionator Shopping** tab
8. Click **Start** — the addon buys only what is needed to reach your targets; items already fully stocked are skipped

### Profiles
Profiles store per-item target quantities and are saved between sessions. You can have multiple profiles — for example, one per guild or one per content type. Use the `+` button to create a profile, `<` / `>` to cycle between them, and `-` to delete the active one.

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/restock` | Open the Guild Bank Restock window |
| `/restock stop` | Cancel the current run and close the window |
| `/restock version` | Print the current addon version to chat (also `/restock v`) |
| `/bankrestock` | Alias for `/restock` |
| `/rs` | Alias for `/restock` |

## Configuration

Item quantities can be set per-item directly in the UI. Use the **All** and **None** buttons to quickly enable or disable all items in the current tab, or **R1** / **R2** / **Both** to filter by rank across all tabs.

To add or remove items, edit the relevant file in the `Categories/` folder. Each category is its own file:

| File | Category |
|---|---|
| `Categories/Gems.lua` | Gems |
| `Categories/Enchants.lua` | Enchants |
| `Categories/Potions.lua` | Potions |
| `Categories/Flasks.lua` | Flasks |
| `Categories/Oils.lua` | Oils |

Items are identified by item ID for reliability across patches. Names are included as comments. Ranked items (R1/R2) carry a `rank` field used by the rank filter buttons.

Example item entry:
```lua
{ id = 240969, qty = 1, enabled = true },           -- no rank (gem)
{ id = 243976, rank = 2, qty = 1, enabled = true }, -- rank 2 enchant
```

Categories that use subcategory headers (e.g. Enchants) can include `{ header = "Label" }` entries to visually group items by slot.

## Budget

A per-run gold limit can be set in the `Budget (g):` field above the Start button. Set it to `0` (the default) for no limit.

When the budget is reached mid-run, the addon pauses and returns to the main window. It prints:
- Total gold spent for the run (broken down to gold/silver/copper)
- Every item that was not purchased due to the budget being hit

The budget is saved between sessions so you don't need to re-enter it each time.

## Notes

- Only commodity-type items (stackable) are supported by the underlying AH API
- The Auctionator Shopping tab must be open before clicking Start — the addon builds and runs the search itself, no manual shopping list setup required
- In Restock mode, click **Scan for Restock** on the guild bank UI before heading to the AH — scanning is always manual and never happens automatically
- The addon will stop automatically if a purchase fails (e.g. insufficient gold)
- The window is resizable, movable, and can be closed with ESC
- Item states, quantities, rank filter, active mode, and active profile are all saved automatically and restored on login
