# Changelog

All notable changes to GuildBankRestock will be documented here.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Minimap icon was black — switched from path-based lookup to file data ID (413587) which is required for retail

## [0.8.10] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **About tab**: new tab with addon description, feature list, getting started guide, slash commands, requirements, and author credit
- Minimap button position (drag angle) now persists across sessions via SavedVariables

## [0.8.9] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Minimap button now uses the in-game `GUILDPERK_MOBILEBANKING` icon instead of a custom PNG

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- TSM integration: each item row now shows a **Mkt Price** column (TSM DBMarket) and an **Est g** column (market price × quantity to buy); a right-aligned **Est Run** total in the search bar sums estimated cost across all enabled items — both are display-only and fall back gracefully when TSM is not loaded
- **Save As** button on the profile bar: copies the active profile to a new name and switches to it, replacing the delete-and-recreate workflow
- Keyboard navigation for edit-box fields: Tab / Shift-Tab move linearly, Left / Right move within a row, Up / Down move by column across rows

### Changed
- Column widths tightened to fit the two new price columns without horizontal overflow
- Editing a quantity, Target, or To Buy value now rebuilds the tab immediately so Mkt Price and Est g reflect the new quantity in place

## [0.8.7] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- To Buy column now autofills after a guild bank scan: calculates `max(0, Target − In Bank)` for every item and refreshes the UI automatically

### Fixed
- Target Qty field now saves when clicking away (focus-loss), not only on Enter — previously, typing a target without pressing Enter meant the scan would recalculate using the old (unsaved) value and reset To Buy to 0
- `RefreshToBuyUI` no longer errors when the addon frame was never opened before a scan (`tabGroup` nil guard)
- To Buy values are now populated on addon load so the column shows the correct baseline immediately instead of showing 0 for every item until a profile change or scan

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Timestamps (`[HH:MM:SS]`) prepended to every log entry

### Changed
- Log now persists across sessions — stored in SavedVariables (capped at 500 entries) and replayed on login; it no longer resets on reload or relog

### Fixed
- Log scrollbar thumb direction was inverted — thumb now sits at the bottom when viewing the most recent entries and at the top when scrolled to oldest

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- "Scan for Restock" button was not appearing on the guild bank UI — `GUILDBANKFRAME_OPENED` was replaced by `PLAYER_INTERACTION_MANAGER_FRAME_SHOW` in WoW 10.0.2+; switched to the new event with a fallback for older clients

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- ESC now closes the window again — the Ace3 migration left the frame anonymous, so it was never registered with `UISpecialFrames`; fixed by giving the inner frame a global name and inserting it
- Ring enchant rank data corrected: all 5 ring enchants were mislabeled `rank = 2`; added the missing R2 entries and corrected R1/R2 assignment — lower ID = R1, higher ID = R2, consistent with every other enchant slot

### Changed
- Default window width increased from 440 to 1000

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Button bar split into two rows to eliminate cramped layout and truncated labels
- "All" / "None" renamed to **Select All** / **Select None** with wider buttons
- "R1" / "R2" / "Both" renamed to **Rank 1** / **Rank 2** / **All Ranks** with wider buttons
- "Start" renamed to **Start Search** and given more width; budget editbox widened

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `GetAddOnMetadata` nil error on load — replaced with `C_AddOns.GetAddOnMetadata` (the old global was removed in The War Within 11.0), with a fallback for compatibility

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Per-item maximum price: each item row in the checklist now has a **Max g** field. If the AH price per unit exceeds this limit the item is automatically skipped and a message is printed to chat and the Log tab explaining why (e.g. "Skipped Vibrant Shard: 45.00g/ea exceeds max 30g."). Leave blank or set to 0 for no limit. Value is saved between sessions.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Migrated to Ace3 framework: AceAddon (lifecycle), AceDB (SavedVariables), AceConsole (slash commands), AceEvent (WoW events), AceGUI (UI widgets)
- Rebuilt UI with AceGUI: tabs, item checklist, and buttons are now standard Ace3 widgets
- `Commands.lua` removed — slash commands absorbed into the core addon lifecycle
- Raw event frame replaced by AceEvent; raw SavedVariables access replaced by AceDB
- Tab content is rebuilt dynamically on selection; rank filter rebuilds the tab instead of repositioning rows
- Budget field moved inline into the button bar (beside the rank filter buttons and Start)
- Existing settings (items, quantities, rank filter, mode, profiles, budget) migrate automatically to the AceDB format

### Added
- `fetch-libs.sh` — downloads Ace3 libraries into `Libs/` for local development (idempotent, skips libraries already present)
- `.gitignore` — excludes the fetched `Libs/` directory from version control
- Item link tooltips on checkbox hover in the checklist

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Per-run gold budget: set a limit in the `Budget (g):` field above the Start button
- When the budget is hit mid-run the addon pauses, prints how much was spent (gold/silver/copper), and lists every item that was not purchased in chat and in the Log tab
- Budget persists between sessions; set to 0 for no limit

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Guild bank scanning: a "Scan for Restock" button appears on the guild bank UI and scans all tabs on demand; scanning is never automatic
- Bulk mode: buy a set quantity of each selected item regardless of guild bank contents — useful for fresh expansion starts
- Restock mode: load a named profile with per-item target quantities; the addon compares current bank stock against targets and queues only what is needed
- Multiple named profiles supported — switch between them with the `<` / `>` buttons, create with `+`, delete with `-`
- Target and To Buy columns in Restock mode — Target saves to the active profile, To Buy is calculated from the bank scan but can be overridden before starting a run
- Guild bank scanning logic moved to its own file (`GuildBank.lua`) and profile logic to `Profiles.lua`

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Version number is now visible in the title bar of the main window
- `/restock version` (or `/restock v`, `/rs v`, etc.) prints the current version to chat

### Added
- toc bump for 12.0.5

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Log tab in the main window showing session activity: search started, search complete, items not found, purchases, purchase failures, and stops
- Log is in-memory only and resets each WoW session
- Log entries are color-coded by event type; scroll with the mouse wheel

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- ESC now prints "Stopped." in all cases, not just when a run is in progress
- Reset and stop message are now handled in a single OnHide script instead of being duplicated across the stop button and slash command

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Pressing ESC during a run now stops the addon and prints "Stopped." instead of just hiding the window

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Settings now persist across sessions via SavedVariables (`GuildBankRestockDB`)
- Item enabled states, quantities, and the active rank filter (R1/R2/Both) are all saved automatically on change and restored on login

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Split main lua into `GuildBankRestock.lua` (core logic), `UI.lua` (frames and handlers), and `Commands.lua` (slash commands)

### Added
- Column headers (Item, Qty) above the checklist
- ESC now closes the window

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-13

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-13
